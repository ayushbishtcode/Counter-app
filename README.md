# Counter App

A very simple counter / clicker app for learning basic JavaScript DOM, event listeners, and localStorage.

## Features

- Shows a number on the screen.
- `+1` button increases the count.
- `Reset` button sets the count back to 0.
- Saves the value in `localStorage` so it persists on refresh.

## What I learned

- Selecting elements with `document.getElementById`.
- Adding click event listeners to buttons.
- Managing simple state with a JavaScript variable.
- Using `localStorage.setItem` and `localStorage.getItem` to persist data.

- Happy Coding 💻
